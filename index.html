<h1>Attention Mr Honey Bee</h1>
<p>Guess what I did? I'm learning a new skill! here's what it took</p>
<h2>Tutorial on Free Code Camp</h2>
<p>This part was actually kinda easy, but it ended up taking me through dozens of other steps which I will outline below</p>
<h2>Downloading Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>again, easy, and I got to write my first try. Thought it would work like a charm - hint: it didn't</p>
<h2>GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>okay so I couldnt get my site live because I needed a domain and hosting. After some research, I found Github pages. Now setting this up was a lil more complicated...</p>
<h2>Github Desktop</h2>
<p>I had to get the Github Desktop app AND GIT itself (whatever that is idek I'm the blind leading the blind rn) and then connect that to Visual Studio Code and create a repository with a specific name and voila! I have a live site. This will be my new practice environment. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
